Hello :)
As a computer science engineering student I had in my freshman year a python class in the first semester but it was a year ago. 

Now I am currently in holidays so I wanted to do a small but nice project to dive again in this langage, that is why I did the simple calculator with the help of a youtube video to understand how it could be done and how to use tkinter because I never used it before.

After watching the video and doing my project with it, I wanted to gor further than just a simple calculator. That's why I got the idea of an advanced mode with more complex mathematical operators. At first I was struggling because I had no idea how to make the switch mode possible, but after a few days and some explanation I was able to do it.
After that everything went kind of fast and I made an almost completely efficient advanced mode, "almost" because the square root and the power n don't work and because we always have to use "(value)" after calling an advanced operator because I use the math library which needs parentheses to use the value which is given. So after : ln, e, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arcos and arctan, do not forget to use parentheses to do your operation.
