Hello :)
As a computer science engineering student I had in my freshman year a python class in the first semester but it was a year ago. 
Now I am currently in holidays so I wanted to do a small but nice project to dive again in this langage, that is why I did the simple calculator with the help of a youtube video to understand how it could be done and how to use tkinter because I never used it before.
